The Simple Doubler is a VST3/AU 64-bit plugin built with the JUCE framework. It is what it sounds like, an easy to use doubler.
This plugin is compatible with both Windows and Mac.

Plugin provides a left and right channel where the delay, single direction pan and gain can be controlled for each channel.
There is also a dry gain control so it can be used in an auxillary or bus channel. In addition, there is a sync button to 
match the right channels to the lefts.
